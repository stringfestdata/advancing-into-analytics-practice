# _Advancing into Analytics_ practice bank

[Cover](cover.png)

This repo contains extra practice sets based on [_Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R_](http://stringfestanalytics.com/book/).


Solutions are available for [students of _Advancing into Analytics_ courses](http://stringfestanalytics.com/aina-waiting/). I can also provide to high school or college teachers using the book in their course. ![Learn more about using _Advancing into Analytics_ in the classroom here](http://stringfestanalytics.com/aina-for-teachers/). You can drop me a line there.   

All datasets referred to can be found in the [`datasets` subfolder](https://github.com/stringfestdata/advancing-into-analytics-practice/tree/main/datasets). There is also ![a file with links to their sources](https://github.com/stringfestdata/advancing-into-analytics-practice/blob/main/about-the-datasets.md) where you can get column definitions and so forth.

# Part I: Foundations of Analytics in Excel

## 1. Foundations of Exploratory Data Analysis

Using the `titanic` dataset and Excel: 

1.	Classify each variableâ€™s type.
2.	Build and visualize a two-way frequency of `Pclass` by `Survived`.
3.	Return descriptive statistics for `Fare`. How does the distribution differ by `Pclass`?
4.	Visualize the distribution of `Age`.


## 2. Foundations of Probability

## 3. Foundations of Inferential Statistics

## 4. Correlation and Regression 

## 5. The Data Analytics Stack

This chapter is all about X. If you would like to get started learning these, some suggested resources:

## 6. First Steps with R for Excel Users

- Run the following code. What happens?

```{r}
temps <- c(66, 71, 68, 74, 70)
days <- c('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thr', 'Fri')

names(temps) <- days

temps['Wed']
```

 - Knowing what you do now, return the values for Monday and Friday first by index position, then by name. 


- Explore the R Help page in RStudio: from the menu click Help > R Help. 
- [Create an RStudio Community account](https://community.rstudio.com)

## 8. Data Manipulation and Visualization in R


## 9. Capstone: R for Data Analytics


- **Extra credit**: Conduct your work in an [R Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html?_ga=2.192006506.1923766174.1629579433-21366166.1628973922) (included with RStudio) or Jupyter Notebook (see [instructions here](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) for using R with Jupyter!)

# Part II: From Excel to Python

## First Steps with Python for Excel Users

## 10. First Steps with Python for Excel Users

- Five Things Excel Users Should Know About Python
- Sourcing Python Packages
- A tour of Python + Jupyter notebooks

## 11. Data Structures in Python

- What is zero-based indexing and where you've seen it before

## 12. Data manipulation and visualization in Python

## 13. Capstone: Python for Data Analytics

## 14. Conclusion and Next Steps

The conclusion offers a few next steps for continuing on in your analytics journey. Here are a couple of "quick wins" on that front:

- If you've not already downloaded GitHub Desktop, do it now. If you have, continue to practice. Either way, the [official Desktop documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) is a great place to learn more.
- Read ["How to Design Smart Business Experiments" by Thomas H. Davenport](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) (*Harvard Business Review*)

Thanks for "advancing into analytics" with me, and.... _roll credits_!
