# _Advancing into Analytics_ practice bank

[Cover]('images/cover.png')

This repo contains extra practice sets based on [_Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R_](http://stringfestanalytics.com/book/).


Solutions are available for [students of _Advancing into Analytics_ courses](http://stringfestanalytics.com/aina-waiting/). I can also provide to high school or college teachers using the book in their course. ![Learn more about using _Advancing into Analytics_ in the classroom here](http://stringfestanalytics.com/aina-for-teachers/). You can drop me a line there.   

All datasets referred to can be found in the ![`datasets` subfolder](https://github.com/stringfestdata/advancing-into-analytics-practice/tree/main/datasets). There is also ![a file with links to their sources](https://github.com/stringfestdata/advancing-into-analytics-practice/blob/main/about-the-datasets.md) where you can get column definitions and so forth.

# Part I: Foundations of Analytics in Excel

## 1. Foundations of Exploratory Data Analysis  X

Using the `titanic` dataset and Excel: 

1.	Classify each variableâ€™s type.
2.	Build and visualize a two-way frequency of `Pclass` by `Survived`.
3.	Return descriptive statistics for `Fare`. How does the distribution differ by `Pclass`?
4.	Visualize the distribution of `Age`.


## 2. Foundations of Probability  X

1. Simulate 100 coin tosses and visualize the result as a histogram in Excel. Do some online research -- what probability distribution does a series of coin tosses follow?
2. Now take the average of twenty coin tosses and visualize the distribution of 100 such averages as a histogram. What probability distribution do the sample means follow? 
3. Plot two probability distributions in Excel on the same area graph: one with a mean of 25 and standard deviation of 8, the other with 40 and 2, respectively. 

## 3. Foundations of Inferential Statistics

## 4. Correlation and Regression 

## 5. The Data Analytics Stack  X

This chapter is a conceptual overview of how Excel, R and Python fit into the broader data analytics stack. If you'd like to get started learning other elements of analytics, I suggest the following resources:

- [DataCamp's free Introduction to SQL course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql)
- ![Power BI on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/powerplatform/power-bi)
- If you're on Mac and can't run Power BI, start with [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources) instead

## 6. First Steps with R for Excel Users

- Run the following code. What happens?

```{r}
temps <- c(66, 71, 68, 74, 70)
days <- c('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thr', 'Fri')

names(temps) <- days

temps['Wed']
```

 - Knowing what you do now, return the values for Monday and Friday first by index position, then by name. 


- Explore the R Help page in RStudio: from the menu click Help > R Help. 
- [Create an RStudio Community account](https://community.rstudio.com)

## 7. Data Structures in R

- *Easter egg time!* In this chapter we used the  ðŸ¤“
-

## 8. Data Manipulation and Visualization in R


## 9. Capstone: R for Data Analytics


- **Extra credit**: Conduct your work in an [R Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html?_ga=2.192006506.1923766174.1629579433-21366166.1628973922) (included with RStudio) or Jupyter Notebook (see [instructions here](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) for using R with Jupyter!)

# Part II: From Excel to Python


## 10. First Steps with Python for Excel Users

- Continue getting to know the Jupyter interface. In particular, under the Help menu you will find an interactive "User Interface Tour" to walk you through the interface, as well as a guide to Markdown. 
- Google Colab is a free cloud-based environment based on the Jupyter Notebook. This is a great tool for sharing your data projects on the web. Check out this [introductory Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=5fCEDCU_qrC0) to get started.

## 14. Conclusion and Next Steps   X

The conclusion offers a few next steps for continuing on in your analytics journey. Here are a couple of "quick wins" on that front:

- If you've not already downloaded GitHub Desktop, do it now. If you have, continue to practice. Either way, the [official Desktop documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) is a great place to learn more.
- Read ["How to Design Smart Business Experiments" by Thomas H. Davenport](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) (*Harvard Business Review*)

Thanks for "advancing into analytics" with me .... _roll credits_!
