# _Advancing into Analytics_ practice bank

[Cover](cover.png)

This repo contains extra practice sets based on [_Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R_](http://stringfestanalytics.com/book/).


Solutions are available for [students of _Advancing into Analytics_ courses](http://stringfestanalytics.com/aina-waiting/). I can also provide to high school or college teachers using the book in their course. ![Learn more about using _Advancing into Analytics_ in the classroom here](http://stringfestanalytics.com/aina-for-teachers/). You can drop me a line there.   

All datasets referred to can be found in the [`datasets` subfolder](https://github.com/stringfestdata/advancing-into-analytics-practice/tree/main/datasets). There is also ![a file with links to their sources](https://github.com/stringfestdata/advancing-into-analytics-practice/blob/main/about-the-datasets.md) where you can get column definitions and so forth.
